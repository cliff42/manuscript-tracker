    <h3>About the Manuscript Stemma Visualizer</h3>
    <p>This website is designed to provide a visual tool to explore manuscript stemma, mainly focused on providing a geographic representation,
      allowing for a clear depiction of the spread of manuscritps throughout the middle ages. and any historic trends that may be visible from it.
      With the interactive map and graph tools, you can click on each individual manuscript to obtain more information about it, including when it was created and by whom (if available),
      alongside any sources the data was gathered from.
    </p>
    <p>I created this website as a passion project in an effort to combine two of my main interests: technology and history.
      I hope anyone who comes along this app enjoys it, and leaves with a better understanding of the spread of manuscripts in the middle ages, or at least a new perspective on it.
      Thank you for taking the time to vist my website, feel free to contact me at: INSERT WEBSITE EMAIL if you have any questions/ suggestions.
